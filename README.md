# OSINT-INFO
Open source intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of collecting information from published or otherwise publicly available sources. OSINT operations, whether practiced by IT security pros, malicious hackers, or state-sanctioned intelligence operatives, use advanced techniques to search through the vast haystack of visible data to find the needles they're looking for to achieve their goalsâ€”and learn information that many don't realize is public. Open source in this context doesn't refer to the open-source software movement, although many OSINT tools are open source; instead, it describes the public nature of the data being analyzed.
